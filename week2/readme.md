###Series and Parallel

![Parallel](https://github.com/zevenrodriguez/CIM542-642/blob/master/Breadboard%20examples/parallel_bb.jpg)

![Serial](https://github.com/zevenrodriguez/CIM542-642/blob/master/Breadboard%20examples/series_bb.jpg)

In a series circuit, the current through each of the components is the same, and the voltage across the circuit is the sum of the voltages across each component. In a parallel circuit, the voltage across each of the components is the same, and the total current is the sum of the currents through each component.

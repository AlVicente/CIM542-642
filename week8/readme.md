###Diode

Is a component used to control the flow of electricity. Generally used to avoid back voltage from components that can generate reverse voltage.

###Transistor

Is a semiconductor that allows to connect 2 poles of electricity using an electrical signal. Transistors usually contain 3 connections: 

* Base
* Collector
* Emmiter

There are 2 types of transistors:

* NPN - Negative Positive Negative
 * Apply a positive charge on the ______ and it connects two negative poles
* PNP - Positive Negative Positive
 * Apply a negative charge on the ____ and it connects two positive poles.

In our kits we have 2 IRF520 Mosfet transistors. They can handle more amperage and voltage, but are more sensitive to static electricity damage. MOSFETs are grouped into N-Channel and P-Channel, which are equivalent to NPN and PNP bipolar transistors.
